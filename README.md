# Random GIF Generator - React, Tailwind CSS, Giphy API

Welcome to the Random GIF Generator repository! This project combines the magic of React, the styling flexibility of Tailwind CSS, and the vast Giphy API to bring you an exciting web application that generates random GIFs with just a click.

## Features

- **Random GIFs:** Click the button and watch the magic happen! Our application fetches and displays a new random GIF from the Giphy API every time you click.

- **Responsive Design:** The project is designed using Tailwind CSS, ensuring that the application looks great on all devices and screen sizes.

- **Custom Hook - useGif:** We've implemented a custom hook called `useGif` that simplifies the process of fetching and managing GIF data from the Giphy API. It's a great example of how to create reusable code in React.

## Technologies Used

- **React:** The project is built using React, offering a component-based architecture for organized and efficient code.

- **Tailwind CSS:** Tailwind CSS provides a utility-first approach to styling, making it easy to create responsive and visually appealing designs.

- **Giphy API:** We've integrated the Giphy API to source a diverse range of GIFs, making each click a delightful surprise.
